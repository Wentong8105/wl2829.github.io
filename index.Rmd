## Problem 2
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(plotly)
```

### Focus on instacart data

```{r}
data("instacart")

instacart_plot = 
  instacart %>% 
  filter(order_dow == 4) %>% 
  select(order_id, product_id, order_number, product_name, department_id, aisle, department) %>% 
  filter(order_number >= 30)
```

### Plotly scatterplot
```{r}
instacart_plot %>% 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~department_id, y = ~product_id, type = "scatter", mode = "markers", 
    color = ~order_number, alpha = 0.5, text = ~product_name
  )
```


### Plotly boxplot
```{r}
instacart_plot %>% 
  mutate(department = fct_reorder(department, product_id)) %>% 
  plot_ly(y = ~product_id, color = ~department, type = "box", colors = "viridis")
```

### Plotly barchat
```{r}
instacart_plot %>% 
  count(department) %>% 
  mutate(department = fct_reorder(department, n)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~department, y = ~n, color = ~department, type = "bar", colors = "viridis")
```
